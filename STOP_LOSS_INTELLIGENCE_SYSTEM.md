```typescript
class TradingBot {
  constructor() {
    this.stopLossService = StopLossIntelligenceService.getInstance();
  }
  
  async executeTradeWithIntelligentStop(signal) {
    // Get optimized stop-loss recommendation
    const stopAnalysis = await this.stopLossService.optimizeStopLoss({
      entryPrice: signal.entryPrice,
      currentPrice: this.getCurrentPrice(signal.asset),
      tradeDirection: signal.direction,
      timeframe: signal.timeframe,
      asset: signal.asset,
      marketData: this.getMarketData(signal.asset),

      }
    });
    
    // Execute trade with intelligent stop
    const trade = await this.executeTrade({
      asset: signal.asset,
      direction: signal.direction,
      entryPrice: signal.entryPrice,
      stopLoss: stopAnalysis.finalRecommendation.price,
      takeProfit: this.calculateTakeProfit(signal, stopAnalysis),

    }
    
    return { trade, stopAnalysis };
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Dynamic Adjustment System

### Monitoring Rules
The system sets up intelligent monitoring based on:
- **ATR Changes**: Adjust when ATR changes by threshold percentage
- **S/R Proximity**: React when price approaches support/resistance
- **Time Decay**: Review stops after specified time periods
- **Volatility Spikes**: Respond to sudden volatility increases

### Adjustment Types
- **WIDEN**: Increase stop distance for high volatility/news events
- **TIGHTEN**: Decrease stop distance in stable conditions
- **ADJUST**: Move stop to avoid liquidity pools
- **MAINTAIN**: Keep current stop level

### Example Adjustment Schedule
```typescript
const schedule = await timeService.getAdjustmentSchedule(timestamp, asset, 24);
// Returns array of scheduled adjustments with timestamps and actions
```
