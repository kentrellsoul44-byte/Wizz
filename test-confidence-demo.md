- **Ultra mode conservativeness** (5% more conservative scoring)

### Technical Implementation

#### Core Service: `ConfidenceCalibrationService`

```typescript
interface CalibratedConfidence {
  overallScore: number;             // Final calibrated score (0-100)
  factors: ConfidenceFactors;       // Individual factor scores
  weights: ConfidenceWeights;       // Applied weights
  interval: ConfidenceInterval;     // Confidence interval with uncertainty
  breakdown: {
    factorContributions: Record<string, number>;
    qualityMetrics: {
      dataQuality: number;          // 0-100: Quality of input data
      signalClarity: number;        // 0-100: How clear the signal is
      marketNoise: number;          // 0-100: Current market noise level
    };
  };
  historicalContext: {
    similarPatternCount: number;    // Number of similar historical patterns
    successRate: number;           // Success rate of similar patterns
    avgReturnOnSuccess: number;    // Average return when successful
    avgLossOnFailure: number;      // Average loss when failed
  };
  riskAdjustments: {
    volatilityPenalty: number;     // Penalty due to high volatility
    liquidityDiscount: number;     // Discount due to poor liquidity
    newsRisk: number;              // Risk due to upcoming news/events
  };
}
```

- Real-time market condition adjustments

#### 2. **Statistical Uncertainty Quantification**
- Provides confidence intervals showing uncertainty ranges
- Reliability classification helps assess score trustworthiness
- Factor variance analysis for uncertainty calculation

#### 3. **Better Risk Management**
- Volatility-adjusted scoring reduces confidence in high-volatility markets
- Time-based liquidity adjustments
- News risk considerations for major market events

#### 4. **Transparent Decision Making**
- Detailed factor breakdown shows why confidence is high/low
- Historical context provides pattern validation
- Quality metrics assess data reliability and signal clarity

#### 5. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Interactive UI component with expandable details
- Visual confidence interval representation
- Color-coded factor scoring for quick assessment

### Technical Architecture

#### Factor Calculation Methods

1. **Technical Confluence**: Analyzes multi-timeframe alignment, pattern confluence, and SMC structure agreement
2. **Historical Patterns**: Simulates pattern database queries for success rate calculation
3. **Market Conditions**: Evaluates current market phase, volatility, and trend strength
4. **Volatility Adjustment**: Time-based and market-based volatility scoring
5. **Volume Confirmation**: Analyzes volume profile, pattern volume, and Wyckoff characteristics
6. **Structural Integrity**: Evaluates SMC structure quality and risk factors

#### Weight Optimization

- **Normal Mode**: Balanced weighting emphasizing technical confluence and historical patterns
- **Ultra Mode**: Higher weight on technical confluence and historical success, more conservative overall

#### Uncertainty Calculation

- **Factor Variance Analysis**: Calculates standard deviation of factor scores
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Evaluates completeness and reliability of analysis inputs
- **Market Noise Evaluation**: Assesses current market noise levels
- **Signal Clarity Analysis**: Measures how clear and unambiguous the trading signal is

### Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train models on historical pattern success rates
2. **Real-Time Market Data**: Integrate live volatility and liquidity data
3. **News Calendar Integration**: Automatic news risk adjustments
4. **Backtesting Framework**: Validate confidence calibration accuracy
5. **Custom Weight Profiles**: User-defined factor weighting preferences
