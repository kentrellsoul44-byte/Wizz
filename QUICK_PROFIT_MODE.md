# Quick Profit Mode

## Overview

Quick Profit Mode is an intelligent feature that automatically determines optimal profit targets (10%, 15%, 20%, or 25%) based on comprehensive chart analysis. Instead of manually calculating take-profit levels, the system analyzes market conditions and recommends the most suitable profit percentage for your trade.

## How It Works

### 1. Market Condition Analysis
The system analyzes multiple factors from your chart:
- **Volatility**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, EXTREME
- **Trend Strength**: WEAK, MODERATE, STRONG, VERY_STRONG
- **Support/Resistance Distance**: CLOSE, MEDIUM, FAR
- **Recent Price Action**: CONSOLIDATING, BREAKOUT, REVERSAL, CONTINUATION

### 2. Confidence-Based Recommendations
The profit percentage is determined by:
- **85%+ Confidence**: 25% profit target (aggressive)
- **75-84% Confidence**: 20% profit target (moderate-aggressive)
- **60-74% Confidence**: 15% profit target (moderate)
- **Below 60% Confidence**: 10% profit target (conservative)

### 3. Dynamic Adjustments
The base percentage is adjusted based on:
- **High Volatility**: Reduces target by 5%
- **Strong Trends**: Increases target by 5%
- **Breakout Patterns**: Increases target by 5%
- **Clear Path to Target**: Increases target by 5%
